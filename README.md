# ENGINE PROJECTS
In this repository, there are codes written in Python  in which you will find thermal cycles for Gas Turbine Engines and their theory:

1. Gas Turbine Ideal cycle 
2. Gas Turbine Real cycle  with losses and isentropic efficiency  -- in progress 
3. Gas Turbine Ideal cycles (with Heat-Exchange) -- in progress 
4. Gas Turbine Ideal cycles (with Reheat) -- in progress 
5. Gas Turbine Ideal cycles (with Heat-Exchange and Reheat) -- in progress 
6. Gas Turbine  with Intercooled Compression -- in progress
