# ENGINE PROJECTS
In this repository, there are codes written in Python  in which you will find thermal cycles for Gas Turbine Engines and their theory:

1. Gas Turbine Ideal cycle
2. Gas Turbine Ideal cycles (with Heat-Exchange)
3. Gas Turbine Ideal cycles (with Reheat)
4. Gas Turbine Ideal cycles (with Heat-Exchange and Reheat)
5. Gas Turbine  with Intercooled Compression
6. Gas Turbine Ideal  with losses and isentropic efficiency
